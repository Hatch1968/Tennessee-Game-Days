# Tennessee-Game-Days
Software Used to run a Non Profit Game Convention

This website was developed to help run the Board Game Library for Tennessee Game Days. It is written using PHP and MySQL and is hosted on Dreamhost.

Original design was by Richard Keuler and it was upgraded by Alan Hatcher.

The UI is mainly laid out to be easy to use with a barcode scanner and touch screens.
